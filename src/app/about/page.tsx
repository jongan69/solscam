        <p>
          Scam Sol is a community-driven platform that empowers users to submit 
          scammer wallets. Our goal is to create a safe environment for all users 
          by allowing the community to actively participate in identifying and 
          reporting scams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can submit suspected scammer wallets, and the community can vote 
          to agree or disagree on each submission. This collaborative approach 
          ensures that the information is accurate and helps protect others from 
          potential scams.
